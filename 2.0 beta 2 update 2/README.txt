Hi,
Recently, I've been developing BatchOS 3.0 w/ MarttoSTAR, so BatchOS 2.0 might be discontinued, because I'm already experiencing a hella lot of bugs, so I dunno. I put Calculator & TextType from 2.0 into 3.0, so that's why you experience almost everything the same in 3.0 as in 2.0.

Thanks for reading.

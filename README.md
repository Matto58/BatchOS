# BatchOS is ending!
It has been a fun ride, but since nobody cared about this thing that I worked for years on, I've decided to
end this project. Someone can indeed make a fork and create their own features, I might praise them. If
someone actually makes a fork, then I'll list each and every fork here. The best ones get a star from the
man behind the original project (from me). Thanks for everything.
